### Background
Originally called **Mocha** then renamed to **LiveScripts** and finally to **JavaScript** when Netscape and Sun Microsystems did a licence agreement that included a language ( Just for the sake of cash in "Java's" name and popularity, completely unrealted to the features or any code systax rules)

**JavaScript** Conforms to the ever-evolving ECMAScript standard ( ECMAScript itself is not a laguage but a standard which JavaScripts follows)

 - ECMAScript2015 is the new name for ECMAScript6 (ES6)
 - Browsers use ECMAScript to interpret JavaScript; so from your perspetive they are effectively the same thing.
 - So ECMAScript and JavaScript are the two sides of the same coin (One is a standard, a standard which Browsers uses to interpret language sytax; however other has adopted that standard to form a language)
 - ECMAScript 2015/ES6 needs a transpiler like babel to translate ES6 into ES5 and older versions for the sake of browser's support.
 - ECMAScript 2016 / ES7 is in development...

 **JQuery** is a Library of Javascript Functions. It introduces CS-like Syntax and several visual and UI enhancements. It simplifies the use of javascript in website.

 **Javascript Framework** - AngularJS/Angular2, React, Vue.js and so on are front-end application frameworks used to simplify the building of advanced interactive web-based applications.

 **Node.js** - A JavaScript platform built on browser runtime environment. Used to run advanced operations and applications on server and computers using JavaScript.
